kppInterface 1.6 released April 18, 2009

	48. Pass weak pointer instead of shared pointer to CkppInterface::init.
	47. Comply with kwsPlus latest modification and remove warning

kppInterface 1.5 released March 14, 2009

	46. Update documentation and installation
	
kppInterface 1.4 released September 18, 2008

	45. Exported Openfile code to ChppPlanner class and cleaned up notification 
	    management.
	44. Corrected bad geometry conversion for file opening.
	43. Added the openfile command files.
	42. Graphic roadmap is no longer displayed on overlay but inserted
	    in the Main 3D scene.
	
kppInterface 1.3 released May 13, 2008

	41. Store weak pointer to main window controller when method 
	    getMenuUICommandLists() is called.
	    This pointer replaces calls to deprecated 
	    CkppMainWindowController::getInstance().
	    As a consequence, when redefining method getMenuUICommandLists() 
	    in a class deriving from CkppInterface, function 
	    CkppInterface::getMainWindowController() should be called.
	40. Made attribute attHppPlanner private with protected access methods
	39. Replaced shared pointer to CkwsRoadmapBuilder by weak pointer in 
	    class CkwsGraphicRoadmapDelegate. 
	    Shared pointer loops imply that some objects are never deleted. 
	    However, a memory leak is remaining. Currently, CkwsGraphicRoadmapDelegate
	    objects are not deleted.
	38. Changed the way graphic roadmaps are handled :
	    creation of graphic roadmap is triggered from ChppPlanner through a notification.
	    CkppInterface subscribes to the notification and builds a graphic roadmap.
	37. Renamed some attributes and method parameter in order to homogeneize the style.
	36. Set default penetration to 0.02. Can be changed by compilation 
	    macro. 
	35. Correction of a bug in planner panel: if no roadmap builder 
	    was selected, and delegate was selected, kpp crashed.
	34. Defined enum in class CkppPlannerPanel in order to deal 
	    with arrays (roadmapbuilders, shooters, ...);
	33. If CXXFLAGS and CFLAGS are not defined at configuration, they are set to "-Wall".
	32. Adaptation to KPP version 2.04.500.
        31. Simplify CkppInterface::hppSetObstacleList
	
kppInterface 1.2 released February 19, 2008

	30. Avoid duplication of devices when adding a problem.
	29. Added LT roadmap builder and SLERP steering method
	    (undocumented kineoworks class) in the panel. 
	28. Adding documentation for using the panel in kppInterface.
	27. Added PCA roadmap builder in the configuration panel
	26. Added selections for kwsPlus steering methods.
	25. Adding problems via the configuration Panel.
	24. Added a panel for configuring planners.
	23. Added a default delegate for roadmaps graphical display.
	22. Link with KineoPathPlanner.pc flags instead of
	    KineoController.pc flags.
	21. Added output when menu is created.
	20. In KwsGraphicRoadmap, nodes are now displayed by a cube.
	19. Modification of KwsGraphicRoadmap to allow drawing of each
	    joint's roadmap separately. Joints that will be drawn are
	    selected via their displayPath property
	18. Reorganization of header files to solve some compilation problems.

kppInterface 1.1 released October 10, 2007
	
	17. Modify kppInterface.pc.in to take into account the fact that
	    libkppInterface.* is now installed in
	    $(prefix)/lib/module/$(LICENSE_HOST).
	16. CkppInterface is not abstract anymore. As a consequence, this
	    packages implements a minimal KPP module.
	15. Migrate "start corba server" command from kppInterfaceWalk to
	    kppInterface
	14. Added ON_IDLE notification to handle CORBA requests according
	    to new hppCorbaServer thread policy.
	13. Correction in notification treatment: adding an obstacle is
	    now different from inserting a new list of obstacles.
	12. Assemblies are now supported.
	
kppInterface 1.0 released August 27th, 2007

	11. Replaced ChppDevice by CkppDeviceComponent since 
	  a. ChppDevice derives from CkppDeviceComponent and
	  b. the operations performed on objects of this type only concern
	     CkppDeviceComponent part.
	10. Notification deactivated before inserting each robot body in geometry node.
	9. Minor changes in documentation
	8. Correct the segfault at deletion of a hidden roadmap.
	7. Resolving problems with notifications.
	6. Adding Class CkwsGraphicRoadmap to replace CkwsPlusRoadmap. To
	   use it, just create an instance giving your CkwsRoadmap.
	5. Correct a bug when adding Device in Model tree
	4. Generate doxytag file in order to make documentation of this
	   package available to depending packages.
	3. Documentation is now generated at installation.
	2. Remove reference to hppCore contained in hppCorbaServer.
	1. New general KineoPathPlanner interface that deals with common
	  functionalities like notification management. It is now
	  recommended to make other KineoPathPlanner interfaces derive from
	  this one.
